    WordPress, how many ways can I say hello ?. **AMAZONPOLLY*SSML*BREAK*time=***1s***SSML**  **AMAZONPOLLY*SSML*BREAK*time=***1s***SSML**
    I find it funny that I can write programs that can calculate risk on a share portfolio, do heavy math calculations on tiny hardware devices, help write programs that massive enterprise businesses use to stock take , but putting up my first WordPress blog, was just as massive en devour to get something I was happy with.
    It didn't involve writing a line of code, but there were a lot of lessons!
    What did I want to accomplish ?
    Mostly was super keen to get a nice website up, quickly and easily to share information with people. I have always heard ... things... about WordPress, so I thought it a good opportunity to give it a go.
    I had a few things I really wanted to get into the project
    Self hostedSSLEasy to updateSome sort of database for the articlesPotentially multi user for one dayFollow web best practicesSmall and fastThemed as a bonus for a ever changing look
    What did I learn early on ?
    I started by testing on Wordpress.com just to see if I could be happy enough, and I was, but onto the first point, self hosted. So I decided to move over to old faithful Amazon Web Services and to use a really cheap Lightsail instance.
    BitNami provide a nicely packaged Wordpress image you can spin up at the touch of a button in Lightsail.

    WordPress.com and WordPress.org are slightly different beasts, I had a few assumptions about being able to easily transfer between the two, but if you could it was more complicated than I could figure out in the time I was willing to invest. I think if you upgrade you account you can.

    Self Hosted, Easy to Update, Follows Web Best Practices, Themed, Database driven, Multi-User

    SSL, Small and Fast.
    Not doing too bad at the moment, only two things remaining on my little check lists, or at least I thought!
    The lists of things started then, getting it hosted on domain, making it load faster than it was, getting SSL up and running, and getting a nice book type read to it. So just a couple things :)
    I got a Domain setup pretty quickly using AWS Route 53, the hardest part was waiting 5 minutes, for it to come up.

    SSL took me a while but using LetsEncrypt , a very cool project to provide safe and free SSL certificates to encrypt all the things, and following a guide here got me over the line.
    There were a ton of amazing plugins that I played with along the way, but I really enjoyed a few that pushed some new technologies that I was interested in into the blog.
    Yeost SEO, Glue for Yeost SEO and AMP, Amazon Polly, All-in-One WP Migration, All In One SEO Pack, WP Mail SMTP.

    Getting Google Analytics up was a good idea, mostly makes me cry, but a good idea none the less. I think this was all through Yeost SEO, but I used a few along the way.
    Image: .
    The most fascinating time sink was AMP and getting that to work. It's a special technology developed by Google to make pages load really quickly. Similar to Facebook Instant Articles.
    I used almost all the plugins I could find for Wordpress and eventually settled on a defunct AMP one, but have since converted to Glue for Yeost SEO and AMP.

    Amazon Polly transcription was pretty easy to integrate and I find it fun listening to her drone my own words back at me, so much so that I've left it enabled :) I really liked that it uploads the article MP3's into a AWS S3 Bucket which it can then pull them from just as MP3 files!
    Where too from here ?
    Image: .
    I think the site looks pretty good now, has a few good features and mostly gets out the way to let me write new content quickly and get it out there.
    What's in store for the future ?
    I think that cool changes are coming soon, from the new Gutenberg editor for Wordpress which I'm finding really cool after a few tries using it. To the new Headless CMS movement, which is a bit of a off shoot of the whole React Website with a API / Database sitting behind it.
    I am honestly still tempted to roll my own, but that's offset to let me rather keep exploring and sharing new technologies and my first forays into them.
    I hope you enjoy the articles and potentially set up you own blog or experiment with something you learnt here.

## What did I want to accomplish ?

Mostly was super keen to get a nice website up, quickly and easily to share information with people. I have always heard &#8230; things&#8230; about WordPress, so I thought it a good opportunity to give it a go.

I had a few things I really wanted to get into the project

  * Self hosted  
    
  * SSL  
    
  * Easy to update
  * Some sort of database for the articles
  * Potentially multi user for one day
  * Follow web best practices
  * Small and fast
  * Themed as a bonus for a ever changing look  
    

## What did I learn early on ?

I started by testing on **WordPress.com** just to see if I could be happy enough, and I was, but onto the first point, self hosted. So I decided to move over to old faithful **Amazon Web Services** and to use a really cheap **Lightsail** instance.

**BitNami** provide a nicely packaged **WordPress** image you can spin up at the touch of a button in **Lightsail**.

The lists of things started then, getting it hosted on domain, making it load faster than it was, getting **SSL** up and running, and getting a nice book type read to it. So just a couple things ðŸ™‚

I got a Domain setup pretty quickly using **[AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)**, the hardest part was waiting 5 minutes, for it to come up.

**SSL** took me a while but using **[LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)** [](https://letsencrypt.org/), a very cool project to provide safe and free SSL certificates to encrypt all the things, and following a guide [here](https://medium.com/unicorn-supplies/ssl-for-aws-lightsail-wordpress-8053359a774f)&nbsp;got me over the line.
