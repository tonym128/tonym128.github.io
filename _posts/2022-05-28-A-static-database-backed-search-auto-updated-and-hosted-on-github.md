# Synopsis
[![](/images/2021/10/frontpage.png)](https://ttech.mamacos.media/yousearch/)

I had an idea to create a search site for all the YouTube videos I was uploading with my YouTube New Stories automation project.

You can more read about the video creation project here [The Time I Uploaded 3000 videos to YouTube](https://ttech.mamacos.media/2021/08/25/the-time-i-uploaded-3000-videos-to-youtube/)

And you can see the YouTube Channel here

And a link to the website I created for Seaching the Videos and their descriptions [![tTech YouSearh](/images/2021/10/frontpage.png)](https://ttech.mamacos.media/yousearch/)

And here is a link to the [source code](https://github.com/tonym128/yousearch/)

I actually store all the data in a SQLite database for keeping track of what has been uploaded and when.

If you would prefer to watch me talking about this article and the project and running through the source code see here

**TODO Add the Video

<a name="goal">

## The Goal

The idea was to create a simple boiler plate website which I could use for numberous projects to have a dynamic interface to the data via Github and not worry about the hosting of a server or any other implications of on-going maintenance.

Being able to update the data on a regular basis was also something that was very interesting to me.
